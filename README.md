# GhostEater
Welcome to Ghostrun, a classic Pacman game with a twist! In this thrilling game, you will control a brave ghost as it navigates through a maze, collecting pellets while avoiding deadly obstacles. Your goal is to clear each level by eating all the pellets without getting caught by the pursuing ghosts.


 **Controls**

   Use the following keys to control the ghost:

   - **Arrow keys**: Move the pacman up, down, left, or right in the maze.
  

 **Maze**

   The maze consists of walls, pellets, and power-ups. You can move freely through the empty spaces but cannot pass through walls. As you eat the pellets, they disappear from the maze. Power-ups grant you temporary abilities to outsmart the ghosts.
